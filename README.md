# redTools
redTools is a tool that converts an emuNAND backup to a redNAND backup and vice versa.
A redNAND backup is used to restore it to the SD card using programs that don't support redNAND directly. For example, if you want to setup the Palantine CFW, you need to format the emuNAND using the Gateway Launcher, backup your NAND or your emuNAND as usually, then convert the backup to a redNAND one and finally restore it as a normal emuNAND backup.
If you just want to backup/restore your redNAND, you don't need this. You only need this to switch between emuNAND and redNAND, or to decrypt the redNAND.
